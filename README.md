# Bank Loan Prediction System using Machine Learning Models

The motivation behind making a bank loan prediction using a machine learning
 classifier is to automate and improve the loan approval process. This would help
 the bank make more informed decisions, reduce the risk of loan default, and ul
timately increase the overall efficiency and profitability of the loan department.
 By using machine learning algorithms, the bank can analyze a large amount of
 historical data and identify patterns and trends that can be used to make more
 accurate loan predictions. This approach is more data-driven and objective com
pared to traditional methods and can lead to better decision-making in a shorter
 amount of time. By using a machine learning model, the bank can automate the
 loan evaluation process, reducing the manual effort and time involved in making
 a decision

 We have also included the deployment here.
